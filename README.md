# Uber-Prototype

•	Collaborated with design and develop a web application similar to Uber.

•	Developed UBER replica as a 3-Tier web application with modules including Customer, Driver, Admin and Dynamic billing.

•	Used Advance Messaging Queuing Services (RabbitMQ) for decoupling the communication between client and server.

•	Implemented NoSQL Caching and Connection Pooling for High Performance and used NoSQL database for scalability.

•	MongoDB sharding and distributed data among MongoDB and MySQL.

•	Added an additional functionality where the rider can choose among the available drivers based on the previous feedbacks and ratings. Technologies used: Node.js, Express, AngularJS, MongoDB, Bootstrap, MySQL, Redis, RabbitMQ, Chart.js, JMeter.
